As I sit down to write my first blog on a cold evening in Los Angeles, I recall how fast time flies. I promise not to bring in my philosophical side to dominate this blog post, but I feel that I ought to thank things and events in my life that make me grow as a person. A fair warning to the unfortunate reader out there - it isn't everyday that I experience a flurry of emotions to start a blog, so escape right now if you wish, __because there will be no TL;DRs__.

Now most 'intern experience' blog posts I have read contain the generic blabber that everyone wants to read, but apart from the mundane how/why/whats, I also wanted to personalize this blog with things that I learned along the way - good or bad, and incidents - severe or funny, just so that my lazy self can reread it before her next internship. 

So let's dive in, shall we?

I spent the last three months in _Los Angeles, California_ interning with the Research Team at Snap Inc (yes, it's the parent company of Snapchat. yes, it's the most fun place to work, ever. and yes, it's theme color is yellow. I'll get to each of these questions soon!). Since my sophomore year of college, I had been dabbling with different research problems in the vast domain of machine learning, and in order to satisfy my hunger for exploring more in this domain, I started looking for research internships in the beginning of my junior year.

## How did it all start? 
I had been a pretty heavy user of Snapchat since 2012, but I still wasn't aware about Snap Inc., it's parent company. In particular, the research team. But since my sophomore year, I had been following the works of a few researchers from Snap to assist me in the problem that I was working on, then. I had pretty much forgotton about it when during the intense internship application period in 2018, I happened to stumble upon a call for the 'Snap Research Scholarship, 2019'. 

Most of us undergrads (who do not study in the US) having experience or interest in research work will acknowledge that it is extremely difficult to find a research position that needs an undergrad. Most industries want a minimum master's, whereas for the few selected universities that do offer, the process is extremely selective (trust me, I have a 0/10 acceptance into such programs). So the struggle is real.

Naturally, my first instinct here was to check the eligibility. The scholarship had two categories - Fellowship (for PhDs) and Scholarship (for Masters, and Undergrads - YES!).  The application looked pretty straightforward - Resume, Statement of Purpose, Letters of recommendation(s) and additional document uploads like transcript and papers (if any). 

The application ended around end of October, 2018, and I had pretty much forgotton about it until I received an email that I was a semi-finalist (yay!) and that I had to give two interviews. I prepared whatever I could --> brush up my resume and project details, coding and machine learning basics, and more advanced stuff in the research that I was interested in. The interviews that Snap conducted were pretty unique - there were questions based on my interests, past research work, lots of coding (not generic data structure based, more on API development and pseudocode to algorithm making), puzzles, and questions on some basic understanding of my research area - Machine Learning. These were some of the best interviews I had ever given. They actually felt more like a good discussion, rather than an interview, and all my anxiety pre-interview had diluted by the time I reached the end.

## Joining Snap Research

On one of the cold mornings of February in 2019, I got an email saying that I had received the scholarship (!!!) and an offer to intern with the Research Team at Snap. I cannot stress much on the fact that I was literally crying, partly because of the acceptance and partly because I could finally stop my hunt for internships. It was a stressful period and I was glad it ended well. Due to some personal constraints, I decided to join Snap in Fall 2019, and even though it meant taking a difficult decision (of extending my graduation date by 6 months!!), I can now safely say that I was glad I did it in the first place and it was ALL worth it!

Now Snap Research (btw, check out the AMAZING <3 work they do [here](https://research.snap.com/)) consists of sub-teams that work on various domains of interest (to Snap) - Computational Imaging, Computational Social Science, HCI and Vision. I worked with the Computational Social Science team, as most of my work aligned with theirs. 

## Interning in LA

Nothing more needs to be said when I say that I interned at the best possible place, Los Angeles
