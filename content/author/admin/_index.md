I am a senior at [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/). I am mostly interested in working in Deep Learning, NLP and their applications in creativity. I am passionate about CS + X (Interdisciplinary) Research where X={Music, Social Systems}.

I have interned with the Computational Social Science Team at [Snap Research, LA](https://research.snap.com/), where I worked on comparing robustness of transformer-based embeddings on granular similarity tasks, with [Leonardo Neves](https://research.snap.com/team/leonardo-neves), [Neil Shah](http://nshah.net/) and [Francesco Barbieri](https://research.snap.com/team/francesco-barbieri). At IIIT Delhi, I have worked with [Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/tanmoy) in the [ Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2)](http://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in/), where I explored machine learning methods to capture anomalous user behaviour in OSNs such as _Twitter_ and _Reddit_. I have also worked with [Prof. Timothy Scott Moyers Jr.](http://www.timmoyers.com/) in the Interdisciplinary Lab for Interactive AV Development (ILIAD Lab) on data sonification and building tools for creative AI for Music. 

Apart from pursuing my academic interests, I am extremely passionate about upliftment of women (and other minorities) in technology. I co-lead the Delhi chapter of [Women Who Code Delhi](https://www.womenwhocode.com/delhi), which is an organisation that works towards diversity and inclusion of women in tech. I am a huge advocate of diversity in CS Research, and always looking for opportunities to support them!

I absolutely love singing and composing music. I've tried my hands at 3 instruments (and I plan to master some, explore more). Check out my SoundCloud profile for some late night amateur pieces!
