I am mostly interested in working in NLP, Social Network Analysis, and Machine Learning. I am passionate about Interdisciplinary CS Research and have tried my hands at **Computational Social Science** and **Computer Music**.

I am currently working with [Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/tanmoy) in the [ Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2)](http://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in/) at IIIT Delhi, where I am exploring machine learning methods to capture user behaviour in OSNs such as _Twitter_ and _Reddit_. I am also working with [Prof. Timothy Scott Moyers Jr.](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/timothy) in the Interdisciplinary Lab for Interactive AV Development (ILIAD) where I am working on data sonification and building tools for creative AI with Music.

Apart from pursuing my academic interests, I am mostly working for upliftment of women in technology. I co-lead the Delhi chapter of [Women Who Code Delhi](https://www.womenwhocode.com/delhi), which is an organisation that works towards diversity and inclusion of women in tech.

I love singing and composing music. I've tried my hands at 3 instruments (and I plan to master some, explore more). Check out my SoundCloud profile for some late night amateur pieces!
